# Richard Haines - About Me 

I was born as a twin in a family that already had quadruplets. Growing up in Detroit, Michigan with a crazy, turbulent, always exciting atmosphere, I quickly learned how to work well in a group. I loved being around people and helping others. Being able to support my siblings and grow up with them, created a team working attitude within me, and taught me how to resolve conflict and differences peacefully.

As I grew up, I acquired an affinity for technology, computers, and best of all, how to manipulate them. It was my favorite past time to find openings in my schools' security system and use it to play Minecraft or surf different places on the web. I thankfully never got in trouble, but this obsession continued at home, where I was always keeping up with new technology all around the world. This love eventually turned into an interest of Cybersecurity rather than just plain old computer science and engineering. Why Cybersecurity?

Well, I watched this television show one day. It was called Mr. Robot, and its about a hacker who works for a Cybersecurity company during the day, and is a vigilante hacker at night, who tracks down criminals and turns them into the police. Essentially Batman but for hackers, and I found this idea super interesting! Not the idea of going rouge, but doing something that not many others can do for themselves, which is keep their personal and important data safe, as the world grows more and more digitized. Ever since I watched this show, I knew exactly what I wanted to do when I went to college, and I continue to learn more about it everyday.

Now, I am training to become a Cybersecurity specialist. Someone that people can trust with their data, and know will be kept safe. On my mission for the LDS church, I employed some of these principles as I served in the office as a technology specialist. I loved it. I loved being able to help others and teach them about technology, and I wish to do the same at whatever company I work in the future.
